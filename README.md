# Foundations of AI

Hello everyone, this is the supporting code for the CRI class foundations of AI.

We will have a companion jupyter notebook for each class. 
These will be pre-filled and your job will be to fill them out and answer some questions.
We will then expect the homeworks to follow this presentation.

We have implemented a set of useful functions in the utils.py file. 
These are meant to help you and you can feel free to use them directly in your code.
Solutions in the form of scripts are also available.
